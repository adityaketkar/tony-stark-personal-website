<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Want to have strong online presence without spending months coding up a website? 

This project is a FREE, EASY and CUSTOMIZABLE webpage template, made to deploy within 10 minutes  with **NO CODING REQUIRED**!


### Built With
* [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/)
* [P5.js](https://p5js.org)
* [Dimension](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The whole tutorial is available in **video format** [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A3OzXXQDug) : 

[![Walkthrough](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3A3OzXXQDug/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A3OzXXQDug)


If you just want to use the template, no need to clone/download this repo. The following steps show how to launch your own website : 
1. Click the following button ðŸ‘‡ (Make sure you have a Github account before starting)

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/adityaketkar/circle-packing-personal-homepage"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

2. After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. 

3. The site should now be live at the URL shown to you by Netlify. Let's now change the content of the site to make it YOURS :)
Firstly, upload all the photos you want to use in your website to [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload). Take a look at the [demo](https://adityaketkar.netlify.app/) to decide what photos you would like to use.

4. Now, open your github account and navigate to the cloned repository (a clone of this project) that Netlify made for you. Then go to 

```src > content > mycontent.json```

5. Press the ```Edit``` butoon on top-right of the file window. 

6. Edit the data present there according to your choice. You should be familiar with the JSON file format. If you're not, no big deal. Take a quick tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM). 

* On imgur, right click on your photo and select ``` Copy Image Location ```. Paste these links in the fields which require URL of photos in ```mycontent.json```
* Array elements are rendered as seperate paragraphs for ```Description``` and ```*Content``` fields. The links are also to be input as Array of JS objects. Explaination on this can be found [here](https://github.com/adityaketkar/circle-packing-personal-homepage/wiki/Guidelines-for-editing-mycontent.json)

7. When done with editing, check the ``` Commit directly to the master branch ``` radio box, add a relevant commit message and click on ``` Commit Changes ```

8. All done! wait for 5 minutes, and visit the URL given to you by Netlify again to confirm changes. 
	
9. Share this repo with people you think can benefit from this project ðŸ™‚

**Note** : Change the ```BackgroundURL``` value in ```mycontent.json``` to add a custom background (use imgur to host the background image). Leave it to ```""``` to use the default circle-packing background. Explaination on this can be found [here](https://github.com/adityaketkar/circle-packing-personal-homepage/wiki/Guidelines-for-editing-mycontent.json)

### Possible Errors during Deploying
* Your JSON syntax for `mycontent.json` might be faulty. Validate it using [this](https://jsonlint.com/) tool (Simply copy-paste the contents of `mycontent.json` on the website).

If you're stuck at some point, feel free to raise an issue or reach out to me over any channel.
